        <h3>THINK</h3>
        <p><p>For our chemistry class, we conducted a flame test lab to observe how different chemical compounds produce unique colors when heated. The goal was to identify unknown compounds based on their flame color.</p>
<p><strong>Explain the Problem or Task: </strong>The task was to perform flame tests on various compounds to determine their identity based on the color of the flame they produced. We had to figure out which unknown compound matched the expected flame color of known elements like sodium and copper.</p>
<p><strong>Gather Evidence and Generate Options: </strong>I researched the flame colors produced by different metals and used this information to compare with the compounds we tested in the lab. I wrote down my observations for each test and considered possible compounds that could match the results.</p>
<p><strong>Analyze and Implement a Solution: </strong>Based on the flame color results and my research, I narrowed down the possibilities for each unknown compound. For example, when one compound produced a bright orange flame, I identified it as sodium. I applied the same process for each compound to match them with their correct identities.</p>
<p><strong>Reflect on the Process: </strong>This lab taught me to approach problems systematically by gathering evidence, analyzing data, and testing solutions. I also used creativity when interpreting some unexpected flame colors that didn&rsquo;t perfectly match the textbook descriptions. This experience helped me develop better critical thinking skills by forcing me to rely on observations and analysis rather than assumptions.</p>

        <h3>COMMUNICATE</h3>
        <p><p>For my English class, I gave a presentation on the characterization of Gatsby as part of a group assignment. The goal was to explain what were the main character motivations based on what we had read in the story at that point in time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oral Communication: </strong>In preparation for the presentation, I focused on organizing my part of the content clearly and effectively. I used the speaking rubric to make sure I had a strong introduction, clear main points, and a conclusion that tied everything together. I also practiced my speech several times to improve my pace and tone, ensuring I spoke clearly and confidently. I also worked on my nonverbal communication by making sure I maintained eye contact with the audience and used gestures to emphasize key points.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and Successes: </strong>One of the biggest challenges was managing my nervousness in front of the class. To overcome this, I practiced with my group and received feedback, which helped me feel more prepared. During the presentation, I was able to stay calm and focused, and I felt proud of how clearly I communicated my ideas. My group also worked well together, and we were able to answer questions from our classmates effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection: What I Learned: </strong>This experience taught me the importance of preparation and practice when it comes to public speaking. I learned that communication is not just about what you say, but how you say it. By improving my verbal and nonverbal skills, I gained confidence in my ability to present in front of an audience. This assignment helped me become a better communicator, and I feel more prepared for future presentations.</p></p>

        <h3>COLLABORATE</h3>
        <p><p>For our school&rsquo;s club fair, my group and I <strong>collaborated</strong> to create a trifold board for our Health Occupation Students of America (HOSA) display. The purpose of the board was to communicate the goals, events, and opportunities provided by HOSA in an engaging way to recruit new members.</p>
<p><strong>Organizing the Work: </strong>We divided tasks based on strengths. I wrote the content for the &ldquo;What is HOSA?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Goals&rdquo; sections, while my groupmates handled the design and social media links. We set clear deadlines and communicated regularly to stay on track.</p>
<p><strong>Fulfilling Responsibilities:</strong> I focused on researching and writing, while also helping to proofread other sections. Our teamwork ensured the trifold was well-organized, informative, and visually appealing.</p>
<p><strong>Building Consensus: </strong>When we had different ideas for the layout, we discussed our options and merged ideas to create a design that reflected everyone&rsquo;s input.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Reflection: </strong>This project taught me the importance of teamwork and compromise. By working together and respecting different perspectives, we produced a stronger final product. I learned that effective collaboration involves both contributing your own strengths and supporting your teammates.</p></p>

        <h3>CONTRIBUTE</h3>
        <p><p>Last summer, I volunteered at our local food bank every Saturday. My main task was to help sort and distribute food to families that needed help. Seeing the challenges some people face with food scarcity, I really felt for them and had a strong desire to help them out.</p>
<p>Talking directly with the families made a big impact on me. Their gratitude for the support we provided showed the importance of my role. This experience taught me the value of kindness and community assistance. I learned that even small efforts can really impact others' lives. Because of this experience, I plan to continue volunteering and supporting my community.</p></p>
